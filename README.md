# SnakeGame_v1

# Simple snake game, will add onto this later but just wanted to test out some C# and .NET skills.

# Some errors to be fixed:
* When turning around too fast snake hits its own body
* When behind the score label, snake is not shown
* When starting the game, unclear which piece is the snake if never played before
* When starting the game, the snake could spawn on the map edge, leading to instant game over if wrong key is pressed.
